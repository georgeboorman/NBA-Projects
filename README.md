# NBA-Projects

These projects aim to gather and review player data relating to [NBA](www.nba.com) players across seasons from 1970 to 2020. 

Currently this repository contains one notebook involving:
* Web scraping to gather data
* Data wrangling to create appropriate features for analysis
* Exploratory data analysis to understand the data
* Hypothesis testing to answer specific questions using statistical tests
* Next steps, outlining other use cases for this acquired data

Many of the visualisations in this notebook are produced using Plotly which may not render in Jupyter Notebook. You can see all plots by opening in Google Colab either by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/georgeboorman/NBA-Projects/blob/main/Analysing_NBA_Player_Performance_between_1970_and_2020.ipynb) or on the link at the top of the [notebook](https://github.com/georgeboorman/NBA-Projects/blob/main/Analysing_NBA_Player_Performance_between_1970_and_2020.ipynb). 

There will be a series of notebooks following this to conduct further statistical analyses and building machine learning models for the following use cases:

Cluster analysis to identify whether more than 5 groups exist compared to the 5 basketball positions.

Predicting how many points a player will score in their next season.

Finding the age in which NBA players peak in terms of scoring, assists, rebounds and steals.

Understanding if there are more player trades happening now than previously.

Estimating the likelihood or a player ever beating [Wilt Chamberlain's 1961-62 record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_annual_scoring_leaders) or Michael Jordan's 3,041 points in 1986-87.
